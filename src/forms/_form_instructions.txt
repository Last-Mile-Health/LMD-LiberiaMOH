A. STEPS FOR CREATING A NEW FORM:

    1) Create a new form; easiest to start with an existing form as a template
           - Naming convention for form filename is "pre_frm09_myform.html":
               - The "pre" prefix is the category (options: fhw, fac, moh, prg, util).
               - In "frm09", "frm" is the unique three-letter form code; "09" is the form version number.
               - "myform" is a descriptive name for the form.
    2) Update the <title> element.
    3) Update the <span> element within the "FORM HEADER" section.
    4) Create the form body
           - <input> elements should have class="stored" if they are to be stored in MySQL
           - "id" attribute of the field should match the MySQL field name
    5) In the "M&E Box" (<div id="meBox">), update the three-letter form code and the hidden 'meta_formVersion' field
    6) Update the value of the hidden <input> element with id="table"
           - identical to the name of the corresponding MySQL table
           - should be all lowercase
    7) In the page_deqa.html file:
        a. Add a data entry link to the form in the "Current forms" section (id="currentVersions_div" element)
        b. Add a QA link to the form in the "Current forms" section
    9) In the page_deqa.js file, add a QA click handler
    10) Create the MySQL table
    11) Add a link to the application cache manifest ("lastmiledata.appcache"), under the "# src >> forms" header

B. STEPS FOR UPDATING A FORM:

    1) Make a copy of the form and place it into the "src/forms/old" folder.
    2) Make changes to the form
    3) Update the MySQL table accordingly
    4) Increment the version number in the filename
        - e.g. fhw_sch03_sickchild.html --> fhw_sch04_sickchild.html
    5) Increment the version number in the <title> element and in the "M&E Box" (<div id="meBox">)
    6) In the page_deqa.html file:
        a. Copy the data entry and QA links down to the "Archived forms" section (id="currentVersions_div" element)
        b. Update the data entry and QA links in the "Current forms" section (id="currentVersions_div" element)
    7) In the page_deqa.js file:
        a. Add a click handler for the new form
        b. Update the "targetForm" URL of the old form
